# Color Shifter (Godot Engine web game)

[Game published on Kongregate](https://www.kongregate.com/games/Sasurai/color-shifter)

## What this repo is
This is all the source code, assets and godot project files for the Color Shifter game. 
This means in this repo you can find a simple but finished and published web game, with a basic integration with the Kongregate high scores API.

I've uploaded it as it was after finishing it, so there may be some unneeded or duplicated, and perhaps some old discarded assets and whatnot. I wanted to share it in case it can be of use for someone, but I didn't want to spend too much time on it, sorry for that.

## What this repo is **NOT**
I was tempted to put this on top, anyways, I feel like this disclaimer is needed just in case.
- This is not an example on how to do things properly. There may be some decent (or even good, who knows) code and stuff here, but my focus with this project was mostly finishing a project by myself, where I've done everything except for music and SFX. This means I did some things one way, then the rest another, and didn't bother refactoring. I've been a professional programmer for some years now, but this was my first Godot game, so I've learned things along the way. And as I said I was focused on going fast and closing the project in a reasonable amount of time, while doing the art and all, not on doing a good example of code and architecture.

What I mean by this is, feel free to use anything you find in this repo, and try to learn from it if you can, but be ready to find weird or inconsistent stuff, and don't assume anything is done in the best way possible, because it may not ^^".
